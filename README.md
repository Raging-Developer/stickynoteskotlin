StickyNotes in kotlin

This is me rewriting stuff that should not have to be rewritten.
I am taking a working note taking app that was written in java and converting it to kotlin with compose screens instead of xml.
I am using sqlite because it is easier and more readable than room.

This is already using far more code than its java equivalent and I have not even got round to preferences yet.
Also completely untested so far, but I have not finished working on it yet.
